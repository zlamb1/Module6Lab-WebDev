                    <h3>What is a yurt?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Our luxury yurts are permanent structures four
                        feet off the ground. Each yurt is fully enclosed
                        with canvas walls, a wooden floor, and a roof
                        dome that can be opened.

                    <h3>How are yurts furnished?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Each yurt is furnished with a queen-size bed
                        with down quilt and gas-fired stove. Your luxury
                        camping experience includes electricity and a
                        sink with hot and cold running water. Shower
                        and restroom facilities are located in the lodge.

                    <h3>What should I bring?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Most guests pack comfortable walking shoes
                        and plan to dress for changing weather with
                        light layers of clothing. It's also helpful to bring
                        a flashlight and a sense of adventure!
